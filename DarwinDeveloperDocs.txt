DARWIN Developer Documentation/Setup -- J H Stewman 4/8/2014
============================================================

This is for current setup on Mac running Windows 7 under Parallels and
using Visual C++ 2010 Express (finalized and used to create and modify
version 2.22, late 2011 and early 2012).

NOTE: Up until early 2012 we were still using Microsoft Visual Studio 6
as the Windows compiler and used it under Windows XP and Windows 7.  
However, some update/change in Windows 7 seems to have made the use of 
Visual Studio 6 impossible (it crashes regularly).  So, I created
and have successfully used project/solution files for development
using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.

NOTE: On the Mac side the compiler is gcc/g++ 4.1 which came with
Xcode.  I am still looking for notes on how I acquired Gtk+ 2.22 and 
ported it to the Mac.  Since all executables and libraries were added
to the working copy of DARWIN and are part of the folder/file hierarchy
managed using SVN and our GoogleCode repository, this may not be an issue
for now.  All files needed are downloaded from Google when one checks out
a working copy.

The following processes and packages are documented here.  My hope is to 
explain everything that would be needed to create a Developer environment
for DARWIN -- from scratch.  Also, I hope to explain how to build
executables on both Windows/PC and Mac, and how to create the installers
for both platforms.

Common Packages used in creating DARWIN
---------------------------------------
7zip & 7z (all compression related tasks DARWIN performs)
  Installer for Mac: p7zip_9.20.1_src_all.tar (Mac Downloads folder)
  Requires building on Mac (I think)
Gtk+ 2.22 (all user interfaces)
   (includes supporting packages Pango, GDK, ....)
   Have Installer: gtk+-bundle-2.22.1-20101227-win32.zip 
                     (Downloads Win7 on Mac)
   On Mac: gtk-osx-build-setup.sh (Mac Downloads folder)
           This required a build of gtk on top of Mac Cairo GUI
	   This used jhbuild to create library which then links all Gtk+
	      function calls to equivalents in the Cairo GUI
	   See my gtk folder on Mac for built executables
jpeg-6b (code to manage jpeg image files)
   The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b of 27-Mar-1998
   All source is in "src/jpeg-6b" folder
   jpeg.lib and libjpeg.a built separately from main DARWIN build
jhead-2.90 (code to extract Exif data)
   Source: jhead-latest.tar.gz (Mac Downloads folder)
   see exif.cpp & exif.h in "src/imageprocessing" folder - minor
      mods by JHS to get to lat/long GPS data
libpng (code to manage png image files)
   Copyright: 1998-2007 Glenn Randers-Pehrson
   All source found in "src/png" folder
   libpng.lib built separately from main DARWIN build
   uses zlib1.dll for compression tasks under windows 
      (found in same folders)
sqlite3 (for managing DARWIN database)
   Source files (sqlite3.c & sqlite3.h) added to our source by RJ when 
   DARWIN 2.0 was changed to use an SQL database file format.  See
   the src folder.

Tools necessary for Windows Development of DARWIN
-------------------------------------------------
NOTE: These tools must be installed separately from the DARWIN subversion 
controlled working copy of the code.

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010
  Hopefully, this is still available.  I have an installer, but it is
  web based and may not link correctly to packageas anymore.  If not, then
  not sure what direction to head.
Tortoise SVN
  Subversion based version control.
  Have installer: TortoiseSVN-1.7.0-RC1-win32-svn-1.7.0-dev.msi 
                  (Downloads Win7 on Mac)
Visual Leak Detector
  Used to track down memory leaks.
  Have installer: vld-2.2.3-setup.exe (Downloads Win7 on Mac)
Git
  Not sure why this is installed.  May have to do with version control.
  Have installer: Git-1.7.9-preview20120201.exe (Downloads Win7 on Mac)
  Mac Installer: git-1.7.6.1-i386-snow-leopard.dmg (Mac Downloads folder)
NSIS
  Used to create the software installer and updater.
  Have installer: nsis-2.46-setup.exe (Downloads Win on Mac)

Basic process to modifying DARWIN (Windows)
-------------------------------------------
[1] "Check out" or "Update" a current working copy of the software from 
the DARWIN Google code repository.

  Initial Checkout:
     1 - Create a place to put all of your work.  For example,
     "C:\DarwinDev" would work fine.
     
     2 - Right click on your DarwinDev folder & select "SVN Checkout."

     3 - The window that opens should be filled out as follows
     URL of Repository: https://darwin-ec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
     Checkout Directory: C:\DarwinDev\darwin-ec
       (this should be the path to the folder you created in step 1 with
       darwin-ec tagged onto the end.  "darwin-ec" is the root of
       the DARWIN Subversion managed code repository.
     Checkout Depth should be "Fully recursive"
     Revision should be "Head Revision"
     Now, simply click OK

     4 - As the DARWIN working copy downloads you will see the progress
     onscreen.

     5 - Once this process is complete you may modify, build and test
     new DARWIN code as you desire.  No changes are made to the master copy
     on the Google Code site until you Commit changes.  This will require
     that you be added to the developers list on the Google Code site, and
     that you have a password for submitting changes.  Dr Debure and 
     Dr Stewman can create this access if needed.

  Updating an existing Working Copy:
     1 - Right click on the "darwin-ec" folder and select "SVN Update."
     This will cause any revisions committed by others during the time 
     you were working on your code to be downloaded and merged with your 
     working copy.

     2 - If this step creates any conflicts.  It is up to you to resolve 
     them in your working copy, before "Committing" your modified code.

[2] Making modifications
  This simply involves using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express to create any
  new code or modify old code.  You can build a solution from your working
  copy at any time.  
  
[3] You can test it by setting up a DARWIN runtime folder.

  Important darwin "Project Properties" Settings
  -- Debugging Working Directory: "c:\darwinhome4\system\bin"
     This causes all dll references to be found correctly
     It also means that the "darwinhome-win32-new" folder must be 
     copied to "c:\" and then renamed "darwinhome4" -- otherwise runtime 
     link errors will cause DARWIN to terminate, when you attempt to run it.
  -- If you name this new runtime folder differently, then any commit
     to the SVN repository will change the project for all developers.
     This is a PROBLEM we should solve.

  -- The first time you run DARWIN, it will prompt you for the location
     of its data folders.  By default it will create a folder named 
     "darwinPhotoIdData" in your Documents folder.  This is fine.  That
     folder will contain the "surveyAreas" and "backups" folders DARWIN 
     uses to store all data.
  
Creating an installer (Windows)
-------------------------------
The script for creating an installer is "install_script.nsi" located in the
"runtime-win32-new" folder.  If changes are needed to the install methods,
you will have to read the docs on the NSIS program and then edit this script.
Otherwise, simply right-click on the script file and select the "Compile
NSIS Script" option.  It will create a new installer called
"darwin-2.22-setup.exe" 

NOTE: The version number on the installer is set by the script not by the
version number in the config.h file in the source code.  So, if you want to 
change the version from 2.22, you must edit the script.

===============================================
Now for the Mac 
===============================================

Setting up the Mac OSX Developer environment.

[1] Download and build Xcode, mainly to get gcc/g++ (I am using
  gcc/g++ version 4.2.1 currently.

[2] Download and install X11.  Has nice support for multiple terminals.

[3] Download and install Gedit or some other nice code editor.

[4] Download and build GTK+ for OSX???
  This requires jhbuild and some other stuff -- hope to find some notes on 
  how this went for me in 2011. 
  NOTE: This may not be necessary, as the prebuilt Gtk+-2.22 code is already
  part of the SVN managed working copy you checked out from Google Code.

Building DARWIN under Linux/OSX

[1] The process of creating a Makefile using autoconf, automake, 
  ./configure, etc., is a horror show.  I hope the existing files 
  are sufficient for now.  However, if you create new source files, the
  Makefile.am files in each source folder need to be edited to include the
  new filenames.  Otherwise these new files will be skipped during the
  build.  If any Makefile.am changes are made, then you must use
  autoconf, automake and ./configure to create a new Makefile.

  NOTE (WARNING): There are issues that I worked around manually, that
  I cannot find notes on. If the current Makefile ceases to work properly,
  then I will have to dredge out the books and figure it all out again.

  I ADVISE --- DO NOT work on a Mac version of the software for now.  Work
  only on the Windows/PC side.  Once we have a stable change to add to DARWIN,
  I will figure out how to do it properly.

[2] If using the current Makfile, simply onpen a terminal window, cd to the
darwin-ec/darwin folder, and type "make".  If errors occur, correct code
using your editor, and run make again.

[3] Once a successful build is achieved, you can test the DARWIN Mac
executable by taking these steps.

  1 - Copy the "darwin" executable from the "darwin-ec/darwin" folder, to the 
  appropriate bin folder in the "darwinMac.app"
     Mac Apps are essentially specially organized folders called "Packages"
     
     The darwinMac.app has this layout.

     darwinMac.app
        Contents
	   Info.plist (property list for app - includes app icon)
	   MacOS
              darwinMac (this script sets up the environment based on how you
	         start DARWIN (double-click icon, command line, etc) and then
	         calls "system/bin/darwin" -- NOTE: this must have the same
		 name as the root name of the app package.
	      darwinMac-readme.txt
	      darwinMac.old (older version of darwinMac)
              Docs (the DARWIN help files)
	      license.rtf (our license)
              licenses-etc (licenses on other free software we have used)
	      system
	         bin
		   7z
		   darwin (this is the executable you built using make)
		   Codecs
		 darwinrc (the equiv of config.sys on the PC)
		 etc
		 lib (all supporting libraries - gtk, ...)
	   Resources (icons and splash screen)
        
  So the long and short of it is this.

  1 - Place the darwinMac.app package somewhere convenient (on the Desktop,
  or in your own Application folder will do).

  2 - Copy the "darwin" executable into the folder named 
  "darwinMac.app/Contents/MacOS/system/bin"

  3 - Then to run DARWIN either (a) double-click the darwinMac.app icon or 
  (b) open a terminal window, cd to the folder containing the App and type 
  "darwinMac.app/Contents/MacOS/darwinMac"

  4 - If this is the first time DARWIN runs it should create a data folder
  for DARWIN's use.

Creating the installer for the Mac 
----------------------------------
This is done using the "Disk Utility" app that is part of OSX.  There is a 
"darwinMac2.22Installer" folder that contains everything needed EXCEPT the 
newly created "darwin" executable.  Copy it from "darwin-ec/darwin" to 
"darwinMac2.22Installer/darwinMac.app/Contents/MacOS/system/bin" as you
did when testing.  Now ...

(a) Open the Disk Utility
(b) Click the "New Image" icon at the top of the window.
(c) Find and click the "darwinMac2.22Installer" folder
(d) Set the "Save As" window to darwinMac2.22Insttaller.dmg"
(e) and click "Create"

To install using this Disk Image, you simply copy it to a Mac, double-click
it, copy the "darwinMac.app" somewhere convenient, and use away.


++++++++++
doing it on new Windows 7 PC
++++++++++

[1] Install Visual Leak Detector
    -- vld.codeplex.com/releases 
    -- downloaded and installed v2.2.3 
       (last stable version prior to Windows 8 support)
       vld-2.2.3-setup.exe
    -- let installer set env variables as needed

[2] Install Tortoise SVN
    -- tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
    -- downloaded and installed v1.8.5.25224 (64bit)
       (newest stable version)
       TortoiseSVN-1.8.5.25224-x64-svn-1.8.8.msi

[3] Install NSIS
    -- nsis.sourceforge.net
    -- Downloaded and installed v2.46 (same as on my Mac)
       (newer version shows few changes)
       nsis-2.46-setup.exe

[4] Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express
    -- www.microsoft.com/express or www.visualstudio.com/downloads
       vc_web.exe

[5] Run Microsoft Update to install updates
    -- Security update for Visual Studio 2010 Redistributable
    -- .NET Framework 4.5.1

[6] Check out Working Copy of DARWIN
    -- create folder d:\darwinDev2
    -- check out darwin-ec (Root level, fully recursive)
       From: https://darwin-ec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
       To: d:\DarwinDev2\darwin-ec
    -- successful checkout

[7] Run test compilation
    -- warnings about /editandcontinue flag
       and jpeg.lib and vc60.pdb lack of debug info (linked w/o info)
    -- darwin ececutable was created

[8] Run Debug test
    -- copied all files and folders from runtime-win32-new to c:\darwinhome4
    -- ran executable
       - complained of lacking system.cfg, but used default settings fine
       - moved data folders as it shouold after creating darwinPhotoIdData
         folder in my Documents folder
       - complained of no catalog
       - used FILE/OPEN DATABASE option to open Sample catalog
       - on second run, the catalog opened correctly

[10]Try using Visual Leak Detector
    -- uncomment the #include <vld.h> statement in main.cpp
    -- build darwin
       - error with redefinition of INT32 in jpeglib file jmorecfg.h
       - added a protection to the jmorecfg.h to prevent redefinition
       - build again
       - runs fine

[11]do an update & commit
    -- works with the exception that the Visual C++ solution and project 
       files in the msvc2010 folder have conflicts from computer to conputer.
       Seems the unique identifying number Visual C++ assigns is machine 
       specific.  For now, SVN still manages thes files, and they can
       be downloaded and used as part of the working copy checked out from
       the GoogleCode site.  However, commits from one developer can
       create problems for another.  Just revert these files back if
       a conflict arrises after an update.

[12]create an installer
    -- move darwin.exe into the "runtime-win32-new\system\bin" folder
    -- remove the current "darwin-2.22-setup.exe" file from the 
       "runtime-win32-new" folder
    -- right click on the install_script.nsi file, and select the
       "Compile NSIS Script" option
    -- works fine - creates darwin-2.22-setup.exe
